# Supertext Translation for Grav

Translate Grav pages into your site's other languages with [Supertext](https://www.supertext.com) AI translation, straight from the page editor of Grav 2's Admin2.

- A **Supertext** button in the page editor toolbar opens a panel listing every site language and its translation state.
- One click translates the page into several languages at once: content, title, menu label and meta description.
- Markdown formatting, links, code, images, Twig and shortcodes come through intact.
- New translations are created unpublished for review; translations edited by hand are never replaced without asking.

Requires Grav 2.0+ with Admin2 and the API plugin, and a Supertext API key. No account yet?
